GMS Detection: Oil Palm Trees Health Status Detection System

Description
The GMS Detection project leverages the Yolov8 deep learning model to detect and identify the health status of oil palm trees using drone imagery. This initiative, powered by images provided by Global Mapper Solutions, aims to assist farmers in diagnosing the condition of their oil palm trees, thereby supporting global food production efforts while minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture.

Key Features
1. User Registration: Create and manage user accounts.
2. User Login: Secure authentication for accessing the application.
3. Image Upload: Upload drone images for analysis.
4. Health Status Detection: Detects and classifies oil palm trees as healthy or unhealthy.
5. Result Generation: Provides detailed results of the analysis.
6. History Display: Maintains a history of all uploaded images and their analysis results.
